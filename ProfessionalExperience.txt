August 2017 - May 2019
Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant
The University of Tennessee, Knoxville

As a Graduate Research Assistant, I worked to improve the performance of Compiler, Operating, and Runtime 
systems with CORSys group. Starting with the fundamental study of Compiler, and Runtime Systems, I ran 
the performance comparison experiment on different architectures using Parsec 3.0 benchmark. Additionally, I am 
designing a tool to automate the execution of Parsec 3.0, which takes the configuration values as input from the user. I 
have also started exploring the Pin tool developed by Intel to learn how Basic Block Profiling and Cache Simulation works. 
To understand the advanced compiler construction, I have started playing with the inner structure of LLVM and trying to 
write some custom passes for compiler optimization. Later, in January 2019, I started working with 
Dr. Audris Mockus, and my current research focuses on Repository Data Mining and Software Systems. Moreover, I 
am working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Software Engineering course.
